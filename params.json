This research was modeled after Savage-Rumbaugh's research on chimpanzees crossing the symbolic threshold. It shows the advantages in (terms of learning) of using semiotic symbols over pure indexical (i.e. associative) signs.\r\n\r\nFor more background info see http://www.leijnen.org/docs/Leijnen.Emerging.Symbols.2008.pdf, or the shorter version of the paper in http://link.springer.com/book/10.1007%2F978-94-007-2336-8#section=1052283&amp;page=1\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
