Java code used for language training experiments with deep neural networks. This research was modeled after Savage-Rumbaugh's research on chimpanzees crossing the symbolic threshold. It shows the advantages in (terms of learning) of using semiotic symbols over pure indexical (i.e. associative) signs.
